      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Teaching practice</strong> is an integral component of the Teacher Training Programme of the College because it avails and acquaints trainees with the requisite skills, knowledge and experience in practical teaching and learning. The trainee is supposed to be attached to a mentor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please accept only trainees with a <strong>
          teaching practice memo
        </strong> from The Gambia College School of Education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once posted to your school, the college student is automatically under your authority. The trainee should not leave your school after being observed without permission as it can lead to cancellation of the observation grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trainee should abide by all professional ethics in accordance with the Civil Service Rules at all times.
      </p>

      <p>
        On behalf of The Gambia College Administration, Head of School of Education and my committee members, I thank you for taking part in our Teacher Training Programme and look forward to your professional support and guidance to the trainee.

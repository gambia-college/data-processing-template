        I write with great pleasure to inform you that 
        <strong>
          Mr Ebrima Faal, 
        </strong>
        pursuing  
        <strong>
          Diploma in Education Primary
        </strong> is a 
        Teacher Trainee from the Gambia College, School of Education.  
        
        Mr Faal,
        has chosen your School for Teaching Practice (TP). 
        The duration of this exercise shall be for only one term commencing in September 2021 and ending in December 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teaching practice is an integral component of teacher training at Gambia College because it avails and acquaints trainees with requisite skills, knowledge, and experience in practical teaching and learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teacher trainees who chose to be at your school are therefore under your authority.  Please kindly give them professional guidance and support. All teacher trainees are supposed to be attached to a mentor. Teacher trainees should only teach grades for which they are trained for.  No trainee should leave his or her school after been observed without permission from the school authorities. This can lead to cancellation of observation grade following receipt of notification from the school authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teacher trainees are ambassadors of Gambia College, therefore, they are expected to be punctual, regular, professional, ethical, dutiful discipline, respectful, obedient, humble, sociable, hardworking and productive. In a nutshell, their character should be impeccable.
      </p>

      <p>
        On behalf of Gambia College administration, Head of School of Education and my committee members, I wish you good health, long life, peace, prosperity and successful completion of your teaching practice.
